#  Nuevo juego de Harry Potter en desarrollo


The game will be set in the 19th century, long before the events of the Harry Potter book series. Players will be able to create their own character and attend magic classes at Hogwarts, learn new spells and face dangerous magical creatures.

The game is being developed by Avalanche Software, the studio behind titles such as Disney Infinity and Cars 3: Driven to Win. An official release date has not yet been announced, but it is expected to be released sometime in the next few years.

Harry Potter fans have shown great excitement at the announcement of this new game, and many are eager to explore the magical world of Hogwarts in a completely new gaming experience.
