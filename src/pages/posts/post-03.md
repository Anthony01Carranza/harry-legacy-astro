# Nuevo juego de Harry Potter en desarrollo

![Alt text](/assets/image-post-05.webp "a title")

Going back to the secondary activities, apart from quests, it is also possible to enter caves, raid sneaky wizard camps, investigate fantastic creatures, participate in races with flying broomsticks and much more. All this is reflected in a book with challenges that are completed to unlock more rewards in the form of skins for the team or to decorate the Hall of Menesters.

Therefore, between the main quests, side quests and other activities, in addition to simply investigating the scenarios in search of any object, it is easy that the adventure can last you between 50 or 60 hours passing it calmly. And if you are one of those who are dedicated to go for 100%, you are guaranteed that entertainment is more than assured for the coming weeks or months, because there are even achievements to unlock that invite you to play with the different houses of Hogwarts.

Precisely the castle is another of the last points on which I wanted to emphasize, because everywhere I have found the so-called Flu Flames, which make the function of fast travel to go to any important place, either the castle, Hogsmade or the rest of the world. But it's just that everything is so well recreated compared to the books and the movies, that in the end I just felt like walking on my own to not overlook the majesty of the landscapes, the corridors, the halls, etc.
