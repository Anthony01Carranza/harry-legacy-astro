description: "The plot of this adventure begins very suddenly after you create the character of your choice, either a wizard or a witch. Regardless of our choice, it is about a fifth year student who is finally going to enter Hogwarts school. Normally, all students start with 11 years in the first year, but in our case it has been different."

# Nuevo juego de Harry Potter en desarrollo

![Alt text](/assets/image-post-04.webp "a title")

From that moment on, some of the most mysterious and exciting events take place, but I don't want to tell you any transcendental details about the plot because it is better for you to experience for yourselves everything that happens as you go along. However, what I can tell you is that I felt at all times as if I were in front of one of the books of the saga, because of the way in which everything happens.

Allied characters, evil wizards, magical objects of the most mysterious, secret rooms that should not be visited, classes to attend, spells to give and take, and so on. In short, all the characteristic elements of this universe are present here from beginning to end. This leaves you with a story in which interest in discovering how it continues does not decline at any time, but quite the opposite, because the pace of the main missions is outstanding and I have not had the feeling that it has been unnecessarily lengthened or anything.
